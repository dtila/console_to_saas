# Console to SAAS
**How to transform a Proof Of Concept application to a Software As A Service product**

This book will guide you step-by-step to build a scalable product from a [proof of concept](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_of_concept) to production ready [SAAS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_as_a_service). 
Any development done will start from a business need: this will make things clear for the team what is the impact of the delivery.
You will see different architecture patterns for [separation of concerns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_concerns) and why some of them fit well and some of them not. Everything will happen incrementally and the product development history will be easy to be seen by analyzing commits.
To have our finished product, we will see the two development directions:
## On premise solution
- how the idea gets a shape
- creating the PoC
- bug fixing 
- componentization / testing / refactoring
- unit and integration testing
- extending functionalities 
## As a service
- transforming to a web application
- authentication
- possible arhitectures
- continuous deployment
- tight coupled microservices
- messaging systems / loose coupled microservices

## How the chapters are organized

Each chapter has the following steps:
1. A *description* of the business challenge 
2. An *exercise* for the reader
3. A *technical analysis*  - what should be modified in order to do the project
4. Some *code* that shows how the challenge is solved (also, link to the full code to be downloaded)
5. *Further reading* - if the reader wants to learn more 

## What we will build

The application will be a simple one: starting from multiple word documents we will build a summarizing Excel file. The point here is not to build the application 100% production-ready, but our focus will be on code organization and to discuss the common problems while progressing on this journey.
